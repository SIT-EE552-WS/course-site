In the started project, you have been provided with a class called `NutritionFacts`.  Every field in this class is optional but final, 
meaning they must be set in the constructor if at all.  We could create multiple constructors, but with so many properties, 
the number of constructors you would need to write grows exponentially.

Using the Builder Pattern discussed in class to write a `NutritionFactBuilder` class that will create an instance of the `NutritionFacts` 
class.
