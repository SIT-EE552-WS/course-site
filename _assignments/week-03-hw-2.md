In class, we saw how to draw animated cars using objects.  Each car had a 
position and a speed.  Modify the car object so that it also has a color property.  Then fill in the bodies of 
`setup()` and `draw()` so that you have three cars of different colors
traveling across the screen at different speeds.  Write the program so that it saves an image
when the first car reaches the end of the screen named `photo-finish.png`.  Submit this image
along with your code.
