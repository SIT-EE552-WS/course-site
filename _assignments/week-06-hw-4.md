---

Several incomplete classes are provided in the starter project that each implement the `Comparable` interface.  Write the body of the `compareTo` 
method for each of these classes such that it behaves as follows:

* An `AppleBasket`should be sorted by the number of apples it contains.
* A `Person` should be sorted alphabetically by last name and then first name ascending.
* A `BirthdayReminder` should be sorted chronologically by date.
* A `3DPoint` shoud be sorted by distance from the origin.
