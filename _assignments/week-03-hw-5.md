A goal of Object-Oriented Programming is to be able to model "Real World" concepts.  
Many companies (and a university like Stevens) have Employee Directories.  At their
simplest, an Employee Directory is a list of employees with their name and contact 
information.  The Employees are typically grouped into Departments.  A Department 
will have a Manager.

Describe how you would model an Employee Directory using Java objects.  In writing
your design, consider what objects you will need, what fields each object should have, 
and what methods.  You *do not* have to write bodies for the methods as long as you describe 
what they should do, but your code should be written in valid Java that can be compiled.
