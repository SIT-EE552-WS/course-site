Following the class example of making a button in Processing, write a Processing program 
to draw a chessboard / checkers board.  These boards are typically drawn in black and white, 
but you can choose any combination of dark and light colors.  When you click on a square,
the program should draw a colored circle centerred in the square you clicked on (choose a 
different fill color for the circle from what you used for the dark and light squares).
