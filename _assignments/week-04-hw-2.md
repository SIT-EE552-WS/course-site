week: 4
homework: 2
---

In the starter project for this project, you've been provided with a file called `solarSystem.dat`, 
which has information about the planets in our solar system in a table format, 
and an class called `Planet` with several fields corresponding to the columns in this table.

Complete the methods in the starter project to make the program open this file, read each line,
instantiate a Planet object with the right values from the file, and print out the planet's 
information to the command line (please use the `Planet.print()` method for this);
