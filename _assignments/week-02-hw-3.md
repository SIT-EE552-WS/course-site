title: Sierpiński Triangle
week: 2
homework: 3
---

The Sierpiński triangle is a famous fractal that can be constructed by recursively diving equilateral triangles into four sub-triangles by joining the midpoints of each side of the triangle.  Because it is a fractal, this recursion can be performed inifinitely, but we don't have that much time to wait.  Please write a Processing program that will draw the Sierpiński triangle after 10 iterations of recursion.

The end result will look something like this.
