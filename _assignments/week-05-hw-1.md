title: Lists of Integers
week: 5
homework: 1
---

In week 1, you wrote a program to print out odd numbers, even numbers, and powers of two to the screen.  For this assignment, you should use the same loops, but, instead of printing the results to the screen, each method should return a `List<Integer>` containing the odds, evens, and powers of two respectively.  You can print the lists to the console to check your work.
