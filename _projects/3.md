title: Elevator Simulator
---
Though we may take it for granted when using one, most modern elevators are 
powered by software control systems.  In the siimplest case of a one-elevator
system, the elevator controller needs to remember which floors have been 
requested by elevator passengers and stop and open its doors when it arrives
at the requested floor.  From outside, if someone calls the elevator from the
hallway, the control system needs to decide when the elevator should stop
on that floor - does it finish transporting all the passengers or make an 
additional stop in the middle.  In a multiple-elevator bank, if more than
one elevator is currently in-use, the control system has to choose which
elevator should respond to the call buttons.

## Minimal Requirements
* Simulate a multiple-elevator system consisting of:
  * One internal control panel for each elevator
  * Up/Down call buttons for each floor
* Include an indicator of which floor each elevator is currently on and 
  what direction it is moving if applicable
* The elevators should take some amount of time to travel to each floor
* Interactions with the control panel and call buttons cause the elevators
  to move
* Interacting with the call buttons decides which elevator to dispatch

## Additional Features
You may consider incorporating the following into your simulation
* Animation of the elevator movement
* Implement each control panel as a client-server interaction
