title: Digital Circuit Simulator
---
Digital circuits can be constructed by connecting inputs and outputs of various 
logic gates together in certain configurations.  There are many standard circuits
such as adders, flip flops, multiplexers, etc.  In can be useful when designing
new circuits to be able to simulate the circuit using software rather than 
taking the time to phycially connect all the components.

As a reminder, the core logic gates are:
* NOT 
  * 0 → 1
  * 1 → 0 
* AND
  * 0,0 → 0
  * 0,1 → 0
  * 1,0 → 0
  * 1,1 → 1
* OR
  * 0,0 → 0
  * 0,1 → 1
  * 1,0 → 1
  * 1,1 → 1
* NAND
  * 0,0 → 1
  * 0,1 → 1
  * 1,0 → 1
  * 1,1 → 0
* NOR
  * 0,0 → 1
  * 0,1 → 0
  * 1,0 → 0
  * 1,1 → 0
* XOR
  * 0,0 → 0
  * 0,1 → 1
  * 1,0 → 1
  * 1,1 → 0
* XNOR
  * 0,0 → 1
  * 0,1 → 0
  * 1,0 → 0
  * 1,1 → 1

## Minimal Requirements
* Evaluate each of the logic gates above
* Create an interface to compose simple circuits from a network 
  of logic gates (including possible feedback loops)
* Create an interface to group these simple circuits together and compose
  their inputs and outputs into more complex circuits
* Provide a way to provide input signals to the circuits
* Provide a way to visualize the output of circuits over time
* Provide a way to save and load circuit designs to/from a file

## Additional Features
* Can you draw the circuit using the statndard graphical symbols for each?
* Can your inteface be graphical and allow the user the drag and drop logic
  gates and connectors?
