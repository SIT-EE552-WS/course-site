title: Printed Circuit Boards
---
Modern printed circuit boards (PCBs) are often designed in software and then etched using computer-numeric controlled (CNC)
machinery.  CNC machines use a language called G-Code to represent the steps needed to produce the desired object.  You can use
[this website](https://www.intuwiz.com/rectangle.html) to see an example of how a CNC machine would represent engraving a rectangle.

The goal of this project is to write a program that allows users to design and visualize PCBs using G-Code or some similar format.
You do not need to implement the whole G-Code standard - just whatever subset is necessary to design some simple PCBs.

## Minimal Requirements
The software must:
* Allow the users to interactively layout a PCB
* Support etching straight lines and simple curves
* Save the design to a file (using GCode or similar format)
* Read in files written in the above format to load in a previously designed PCB.
* Provide some visualization of the designed board

## Additional Feature Ideas
* Can the visualization be 3-dimensional?
* Is the interface for the program, point-and-click vs text-based?
* Can you support more complex curves and rounded corners?
* Can you support automatic or assisted routing of connections?
