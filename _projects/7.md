title: Checkers (for real this time)
---
We already made a version of a checkers board in an earlier assignment, but
it had many flaws that prevent it from being used for a real game of checkers.
First, it allowed the user to put pieces on every square.  Second, it allowed the user
to conjure new pices out of thin air.  What would it take to turn this into a 
fully-fledged, multi-player checkers game?

## Minimal Requirements
* Rework the checkers board so that it only allows pieces in valid
  positions
* A turn tracker so that each the color of movable pieces alternates on each 
  turn
* Restrict the user whose turn it is to only making valid movements
  * Move to one free space diagonally
  * Jump over one or more opponents's pieces
  * Reverse direction when the piece is "kinged"
* Identify when one of the players has won
* Keep a persistent record of games played - who were the players, who won, how
  many moves did it take

## Additional Feature Ideas
* What would it take to make the game work between two remote players over a 
  network?
* Can you animate the movement of the checkers pieces?
* Can you represent the game in 3D vs 2D?
