title: Quiz Designer
---
Create a quiz designer program that will let an instructor create quizzes.  In
general, a quiz is made up of a list of questions.  Each question has one-or-more
correct answers and some point value.  There are many types of questions including:
* Multiple Choice (choose one correct answer)
* Multiple Answer (choose all correct answers)
* Fill in the blank(s)
* Text answer
* True/False Question
* Matching question (link definitions and terms)
* etc.

Think about what the structure of these types of questions might be.  What do
they have in common?  What sets them apart?

## Minimal Requirements
When using your program, users can:
* Create a new quiz
* Add questions to the quiz
* Set the type of each question (you can support as many types as you like but
  must be a minimum of three types)
* Configure each question depending on the type selected including prompts and 
  answer keys
* Save the quiz in some file format
* Open and edit a saved quiz

## Additional Feature Ideas 
You may want to consider these additional features in your design:
* An interface to preview the quiz (i.e. display the questions and simulate 
  grading answers).
* A virtual gradebook so the instructor can send a link to the quiz and collect
  grades from student submissions
