title: An Integrated Development Environment
---
Hopefully, over the course of the semester, you've come to appreciate how useful the IDE can be in developing Java code,
but have you ever stopped to wonder how the IDE works?

On the surface, the IDE may seem simple - the user writes code, clicks a button, and that code is compiled an executed, but 
the IDE does a lot more than that including provdiing intelligent autocompletion suggestions, highlighting syntax errors, letting 
you organize your files, and letting you do live debugging.  The three most popular IDEs for writing Java are also written in Java.  
This is your chance to find out how it all works by implementing your own simple IDE.

## Minimal Requirements
Create a program that allows you to:
* Write and format Java code
* Save your source code to the hard drive and read it back
* Compile and execute the Java code
* If there are compiler errors, display those in your interface

## Additional Feature Ideas
* Can you provide autocomplete capabilities?
* Can you offer a live debugger?
* Can you integration with Git or other useful tools?
* Can you detect errors in realtime?
* Can you offer support for automated refactoring?
