title: Spreadsheets Galore 
---
Microsoft Excel and its predecessor VisiCalc revolutionized the workplace.  It was not long after they were introduced that spreadsheets were
_everywhere_ int he business world.

At its core, a spreadsheet is a simple concept.  Values are held in cells organized into columns and rows.  Groups of columns and rows can be 
grouped into sheets.  Cell values can be calculated using formulas tha reference the values stored in other cells.  And with that simple format,
countless business-critical reports can be built and maintained.

## Minimal Requirements
Create a program that allows you to:
* Define worksheets made up of a flexible number of cells and columns
* Populate each cell with values or formulas
* Calculate formulas based on the cells those formulas reference
* Save spreadsheets to files and read spreadsheets from files

## Additional Feature Ideas
* Does your interface allow editing the format of cells?
* Can you generate summary reports from a spreadsheet (e.g. pivot tables in Excel)?
* Can you export your spreadsheet in a way that is compatible with Microsoft Excel?
* Can you import data, for example, from CSV files?
