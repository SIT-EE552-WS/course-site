title: Investment Portfolio Simulator
---
Design an interface that will simulate an investment portfolio.  The user can 
buy and sell various types of financial instruments and be able to view the 
current state of their portfolio.  Additionally, before buying or selling 
something, the user should be able to look up key information about the 
instrument.  Such as:

* Security
  * Stock (price, dividend, yield)
  * Bond/fixed income (price, coupon, yield, expdate)
* Cash (interest)
* Municipal bond (price, coupon, yield, expdate, taxation?)
* Treasury Bond

You can decide as part your design which types of instruments you want to 
support (minimum three types of instruments).

## Mimimal Requirements
The simulation must allow the user to do the following:
* Add / withdraw cash balance
* Buy and sell securities as long as the user has sufficient balance
* See their current position (the quantity of each security)
* See their current portolio value (the total worth of all their holdings)
* Search for and view information about prospective instuments before buying
* Save the state of the portfolio so that the user can restart the program and
  not lose their data

## Additional Feature Ideas
Additional features you may want to consider:
* Displaying useful information as graphs
* Display Real-time price information
