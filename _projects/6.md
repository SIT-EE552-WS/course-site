title: Virtual Orrery
---
An Orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system.  The first known modern
mechanical orrery was made in England in 1704.  In this course, you have already
gotten some experience simulating planetary rotation.  This project involves
extending that model to a fully 3-dimenional model incorporating rotation around 
the sun and relative sizes of the various celestial bodies.

## Minimal Requirements
* Create a scale 3D representation of the solar system
* Use one of the accepted mathematical models to calculate the positions 
  of each of the main planets as a function of time
* Include an interface for navigating through this simulation in 3D space (pan,
  zoom, tilt)
* Include an interface for changing the time-scale of the simulation

## Additional Feature Ideas
* Can you add some of the known moons around their respective planets?
* What about the asteriod belt?
* Can you add annotations to the viewer interface that provide information 
  about whatever bodies are inview?
